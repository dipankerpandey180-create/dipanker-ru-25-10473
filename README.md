Mini Calculator in C
A lightweight, console-based arithmetic calculator built using the C programming language. This project demonstrates the use of modular programming through functions, user input handling, and control flow using switch-case statements.

Features
Addition (+): Adds two integers.

Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second integer from the first.

Multiplication (*): Multiplies two integers.

Division (/): Performs floating-point division with a built-in check for division by zero to prevent crashes.

Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of two integers.

 How It Works
The program follows a standard procedural flow:

Function Declarations: At the top to inform the compiler about the mathematical functions.

User Menu: Displays available operations.

Input Handling: Takes the user's choice and two numeric operands.

Switch Logic: Routes the input to the appropriate function based on the user's choice.

Function Definitions: Separate logic for each mathematical operation for better readability and reusability
